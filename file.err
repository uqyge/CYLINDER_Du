 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.438   TIME= 08:52:48
 Poisson's ratio NU set for material 1 deleted.                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.438   TIME= 08:52:48
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.516   TIME= 08:52:48
 The MINREF field of the CNVTOL command has been assigned a default      
 value of 1.0 for convergence on F.  Check results carefully.            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.547   TIME= 08:52:48
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.
