 accurate results in quad or brick shape.

 The MINREF field of the CNVTOL command has been assigned a default      
 value of 1.0 for convergence on F.  Check results carefully.

 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.
